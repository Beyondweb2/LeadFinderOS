// THE FINDABLE OFFER — the one place the price and the guarantee wording live.
//
// Imported by BOTH the SPA and edge functions (findable-checkout, stripe-webhook),
// so this file must stay dependency-free and edge functions must import it with a
// RELATIVE path and an explicit .ts extension (like reportSlug.ts) — never the @/
// alias, which Deno's bundler rejects outright (see CLAUDE.md §4).
//
// ⚠️ CROSS-REPO SEAM: findable-site is a separate repo and cannot import this.
// Its copy lives in findable-site/src/lib/site.ts (GUARANTEE) and the price is
// displayed in its OnboardingFlow.tsx. Changing either value here means a matching
// pass there.
// ⛔ THE COMMENT USED TO SAY IT WAS "the only guard", AND IT FAILED. The guarantee
// drifted and nobody noticed for weeks. There is now a real check in each repo:
//   node scripts/check-guarantee-sync.mjs
// It reads the other repo off disk and exits non-zero on any byte difference. The
// PRICE is still guarded by nothing but this comment.

   ⛔ BYTE-IDENTICAL TO findable-site's GUARANTEE, and asserted by scripts/check-guarantee-sync.mjs
   in BOTH repos. It is the sentence the Stripe line item charges against, the sentence the audit
   report prints, the sentence the client request sheet prints, and the sentence on the marketing
   site. A customer must not agree to one wording at checkout and read a different one on the page
   that sold it to them.
   ⚠️ THEY HAD DRIFTED. This copy ended at "We do not promise you will be named."; the site's carried
   a further sentence — "The engines decide that, and anyone who promises it is guessing" — which is
   the strongest line in it. Restored here 2026-08-06, longer version wins. */

/* ⛔ WHERE A PROSPECT'S REPORT LIVES. findable.live/report/<auditId> — a Cloudflare Pages Function in

   function and FORCES text/html, because the Supabase gateway serves that function as text/plain
   with nosniff and a sandbox CSP. The upstream function URL must never be given to a human.
   Deliberately NOT PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN: that is the barber product's yoursites.uk, and coupling the
   AI-visibility report to it is what left the share link pointing at a dead route.

   invite and we accept it.
   ⛔ NOT THE REQUEST-ACCESS FLOW, and the reason is the deciding one: Google's request-access path
   emails whoever claimed the profile — very often an old address at a web company nobody has spoken
   to in years — and runs a 3-7 day timer that can end in an ownership transfer nobody asked for.
   That is not something to build a week-one step on. Owner-adds-us lands in our inbox in seconds and
   we know it worked because we are the one accepting.
   ⚠️ IT MUST BE A GOOGLE ACCOUNT. Google will not accept a manager address that is not one.
